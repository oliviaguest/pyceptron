pyceptron
=========

A very simple perceptron neural network  written in python with a simple GUI.

Running it will make it learn to classify (i.e., the output units on the right) patterns with one 1 and two 0s as all outputs off (aka 0) and patterns with one 0 and two 1s as all outputs on (aka 1).
