Pyceptron is a simple perceptron network with a simple graphical output. I used this code for a workshop I ran in 2014: [Introduction to Computational Cognitive Modelling](https://sites.google.com/site/introcompcog/). It is written with an emphasis on readability and clarity for people who have never programmed before. Feel free to use it for pedagogical or other purposes. If you do [contact me](olivia@oliviaguest.com). I'd love to hear what you do with it.
